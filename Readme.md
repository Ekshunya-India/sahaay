## Help, Problem, Stories Tracker for India 
An **Open Source Social Improvement Platform for India**. This platform lets users track Help Requests, Problems, Stories around a location. This platform aims to be the bridge between People in Need to People who can help, it aims to be the guide to People with Solutions, leading towards problems faced by everyday indians. Its Mission is to solve big problems of india like hunger, medical needs of the poor, Clothing needs of the poor, infrastructure upgrade/repair requests, etc. 

One line of code at a time, One Service at a time, One Electoral Ward at a time. It is a huge unimaginable task. The first step is listing the problems/help-requests/stories so that everyone is at-least aware of them. How can this be achived? *Awareness,Transparency and with everyone's help.*    
  
In India lot of people have smart phones. Smart Phones have entered even the heart of villages. This is a stab at an open source solution for trying to create a tracker which will create awareness and bring transperency to everyday problems.
